### Managing Message Senders

This integration is using a combination of [OrderCloud Message Senders](https://ordercloud.io/knowledge-base/message-senders) and custom triggered emails in app code to send emails. For any message sender triggered email type (NewUser, OrderApproval, OrderSubmit, and PasswordReset) you can define more granularly to whom these emails should be sent to by party (Buyer, Seller, or Supplier). To do this manage message senders in the OrderCloud portal and toggle on/off message types.

## Enabling Integration

1.  Set `EnvironmentSettings:EmailServiceProvider` to SendGrid
2.  Ensure `EnvironmentSettings:ApiKey` and `SendgridSettings:FromEmail` are defined in your app settings
3.  Ensure for each email type that you want to send that `{emailtype}TemplateID` is defined in app settings. You can use [these default templates](https://github.com/ordercloud-api/headstart/tree/development/assets/templates/email) as a starting point but will want to update the contact email and may want to add a company banner
4.  Deploy your middleware application. Emails won't work until the first deployment because there needs to be a publicly accessible endpoint that OrderCloud can send event information to.
